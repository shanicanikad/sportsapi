Mr. Miller's Sports Club

Welcome to Mr. Miller's Sports Club. Let's Get Healthy Together!



Here, (https://shanicanikad.github.io/miller1/#/), the user is directed to the home page. 


On the home page, the user can click on either two buttons: "Sports" and "Contact". Clicking on one of either of these buttons redirects the user to another page. 



When directed to the "Sports" tab, the user will be redirected to the 'Sports' page where he or she can view the two different sports currently available with a description. Under the two currently available sports, the user will view the locations, ages, dates, and times that he or she can book. After viewing, the user can click "Click to Schedule" in which an alert will appear, "Your Entry Has Been Recorded". 




When directed to the "Contact" tab, the user will be redirected to the 'Contact' page where he or she can input their first and last name, phone number, and email address into forms. After filling this information out, the user can click "Click Here", in which an alert will pop up, "We will be in touch soon!" 



At the bottom of the home page, there is a "Subscibe" button and next to the button is a form that the user can enter their email address. When the user clicks the "Subscribe" button, an alert will pop up on the screen saying, "Thank You For Subscribing!"
